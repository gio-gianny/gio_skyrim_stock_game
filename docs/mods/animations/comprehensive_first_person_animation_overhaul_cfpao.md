# Comprehensive First Person Animation Overhaul - CFPAO

```project_info
homepage: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87169
about: Adds thousands (yes, I checked and it is actually in the thousands) of first person animations that overwrite the vanilla ones. Includes unique animations depending on weapon type (so axes, maces, and daggers are no longer used like swords). Does not require Nemesis or FNIS to work.
requirements:
    - Open Animation Replacer
downloads:
    - Comprehensive First Person Animation Overhaul
```
