# Dova Jump

```project_info
homepage: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125550
about: Using the latest advances in science and technology, I decided to create my own jump animations for the dragonborn. I created them on my own, because I wanted to diversify the small collection of jump mods that can be found on the Nexus.
requirements:
    - Better Jumping SE
    - Jump Slide Fix OAR
    - Open Animation Replacer
    - Slip off Slopes
    - True Directional Movement - Modernized Third Person Gameplay
downloads:
    - DOVAJUMP
