# Fores New Idles in Skyrim SE - FNIS SE

```project_info
homepage: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3038
about: "No custom animation possible for Skyrim? Wrong. FNIS Behaviors allows to add different types of animations to the game: idles/poses, sequenced, furniture, paired, killmoves, creatures, and others."
requirements:
downloads:
    - FNIS Spells SE 7.0
    - FNIS Creature Pack SE 7.6
```

!!! warning

    We only need the animations packs to use with [Pandora](pandora.md), not the actual
    FNIS mod.
