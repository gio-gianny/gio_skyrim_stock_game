# Lively cart driver animation replacer or OAR

```project_info
homepage: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70595
about: New 50 sec long detailed carttraveldriveridle.hkx animation I made with an ai video mocap as a base. Goes in place of short samey vanilla animation. They can move their left hand how! Install or uninstall it at any point - it's just a replacement .hkx animation file. Works with Special Edition or Anniversary Edition Skyrim.
requirements:
    - Open Animation Replacer
downloads:
    - Lively Cart Driver Animations (OAR)
```
