## FOMOD settings

```fomod_settings
pages:
    - name: Options
      sections:
        - name: Texture Resolution
          default:
            value: 4K defaultwater.dds
            notes: Beeger 4K defaultwater.dds
          selected:
            value: 2K defaultwater.dds
            notes: Smoler 2K defaultwater.dds
        - name: Water Tweaks
          default:
            value: Include Water Tweaks - No Flow Map
            notes: Some small changes I've made to color, transparency, and speed. Also disables flow maps, which can result in better performance. You don't need Cathedral Water activated if you pick this option.
