??? question "Mod's FAQ"

    *How do I know if a height map is found for the worldspace I am in?*

    Look for the debug menu in the CS config GUI, under Terrain Shadows.

    ---

    *Where can I see the effects?*

    High mountains at dawn/dusk, on world map or at a distance (shadows around the camera are covered by vanilla shadow maps).
    Note that vanilla sun angles are quite high even at daybreak. You can optionally pair the feature with EVLaS or weather mods like NAT3ï»¿ that dramatically lowers the sun angle at sunrise/sunset.

    *Is it compatible with [Insert World Map Mod]?*

    Yes.

    ---

    *Are terrain underside meshes still needed?*

    Not necessary for the mod to work.

    ---

    *Why allow height maps in the HeightMaps directory to override xLODGen output?*

    Height maps should be independent from xLODGen. The maps are for different purposes and should be treated as such. People might want to use a higher precision map than what xLODGen can offer, or use a cropped version for better performance.
