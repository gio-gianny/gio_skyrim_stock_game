!!! question "I uninstalled the mod and now I cannot draw my weapons or shout."

    Before uninstall you should stop or reset the backshield effect and save your game
    through the menu (no quicksave).

    Even if you haven't done so your last regular save (not quicksave or autosave) should
    be working fine. **If not, reinstall the mod and do a proper uninstall.**
