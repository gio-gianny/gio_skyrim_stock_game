## Common Questions

!!! question "When I try to use the sliders in-game, they don’t do anything!"

    Try rebuilding, and make sure you have ‘Build Morphs’ checked. Make sure nothing is
    overwriting the body. See if the requirements – RaceMenu and XP32 Maximum Skeleton
    Extended – are working correctly. You may need to use a different version of RaceMenu
    depending on your version of the game. To check if XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended is
    working, verify via the in-game MCM.
