# Leveling Freedom - Configure your XP Curve - Gentler Smoother Steeper or Flat

```project_info
homepage: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69589
about: Configure your own leveling curve! Settings are saved with each character via an MCM.
requirements:
    - SkyUI
downloads:
    - Leveling Freedom ESPFE
```

## MCM settings

Because we use [Experience](experience.md), increasing a skill usually happens only:

* when you get a new level and assign some points to that skill
* train with a *trainer*
* read some skill book

In order to have enough time to visit the trainers and gather enough money to pay them,
I prefer a very slow *learning curve*:

| Setting | Selected | Default |
|---|---|---|
| fXPLevelUpBase | 700 - 1000 | 75 |
| fXPLevelUpMult | 0 - 5 | 25 |
