??? question "Is this compatible with whatever moon-related mod?"

    It is compatible with texture replacers and size changers. Be aware that if the moons are too big, when they overlap, it may not look correct (this is not due to this mod, but an issue in vanilla as well). This mod changes the phase cycle for Secunda, and will be inconsistent with any mods that assume vanilla Secunda phase cycle.

??? question "Is this compatible with whatever random unrelated mod?"

    This mod only changes how the moons and stars move and the moons' phases. These changes are purely visual in the vanilla game. This mod doesn't, by itself, change anything about "lighting", "weather", "time", "calendar" , "stealth", "sneaking", "moon sugar", "werewolves", "vampires", "survival", "ai", or any number of other unrelated things.
