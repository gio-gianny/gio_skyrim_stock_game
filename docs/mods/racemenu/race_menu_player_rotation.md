## Usage

If gamepad is not active, hold your **Right Mouse Button** and move your mouse left and right.

If gamepad is active (detected automatically), hold its **A** and **Y** to rotate left and right.

You can configure all buttons and rotation speed.

Mouse or keyboard keys go to **iRegularButton** option, gamepad keys go to
**iGamepadButtonL** and **iGamepadButtonR** options. All keys use unified decimal
[DXScanCodes](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Input_Script#DXScanCodes) values.
