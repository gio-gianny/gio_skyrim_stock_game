# REMO - Rule Engine

```project_info
homepage: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156676
about: Create and manage mod install order rules, detect conflicts, tag and bulk‑toggle mods, and keep your modlist organized and conflict‑free with a clear, easy‑to‑use interface.
```

!!! warning "Important"

    *REMO* should be run started outside *MO2* so that you can use it in
    parallel with it, without blocking *MO2*. If you make any changes in
    *MO2* while *REMO* is running, click the `RESCAN MODS` button.
