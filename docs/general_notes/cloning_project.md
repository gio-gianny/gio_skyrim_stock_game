# Cloning the project

This project is meant to be used as a placeholder for the actual Wabbajack compilation,
though most of the files that go into the compilation are ignored, and not store in the git
repository. Only these files are stored:

* the documentation files (mostly in the `docs/` folder)
* the meta files for the downloads (in the `mo2/downloads` folder)
* the *MO2* profiles (in the `mo2/profiles` folder)
* some *MO2* text config files
* the compile settings (in the `Gio's Skyrim.compiler_settings` file)

If you want to reuse the project, clone it and follow the steps in this docs for populating
the *MO2* and your compilation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gio-gianny/gio_skyrim_stock_game GioSkyrim
```
