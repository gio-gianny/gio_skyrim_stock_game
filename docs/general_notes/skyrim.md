# Skyrim

## Skyrim edition and location

The project assumes we're moding the **Steam** version **Skyrim Anniversary Edition**, on
*Windows*, installed on disk `D:\` in:

```cmd
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition
```

## Finding your Skyrim version

Many mods are *Skyrim* version specific, so you should always know what your version is:

* find the `Skyrim.exe` you are using

    ```cmd
    D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition
    ```

* right-click it in *File Explorer* and select `Properties`
* go to the `Details` page
* check the `Product version` value

For example, the `Skyrim.exe` version in the image bellow is `1.6.1170.0`.
