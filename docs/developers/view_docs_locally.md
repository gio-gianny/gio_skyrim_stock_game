# Viewing the docs locally

Documentation is created with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Run `docs_serve` job to start a local web server serving a live preview of the documentation:

```bash
make docs_serve
```

The server can be accessed at <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.
